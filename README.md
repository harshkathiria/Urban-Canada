**This application is a modern service marketplace to empower vendors and satisfy clients. It serves as an online portal for vendors, tradesmen, service providers and other entrepreneurs or small business owners to market their services to a wider customer in one convenient location. For the persons or entities providing services (vendors), and for the persons purchasing or subscribing to these services (consumers) the application will provide a convenient interface. This service is important because it will seek to improve upon existing marketplaces to provide a more seamless interaction between vendors and consumers aggregating the pros and eradicating the cons associated with other popular platforms.**
